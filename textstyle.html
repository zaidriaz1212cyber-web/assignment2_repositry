        My favorite hobbies are coding and reading books. I enjoy coding because it allows me to express my creativity
        through technology and solve interesting problems. It feels amazing to build something new and see my ideas come
        to life. Reading books, on the other hand, helps me relax and explore different worlds beyond my own. It also
        improves my knowledge, imagination, and thinking skills. Both hobbies inspire me to keep learning and growing
        every day.
